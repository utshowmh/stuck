# STUCK

</br>

## About

Stuck is a interpreted [stack based programing language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

</br>

## Syntax

Since it's stack based, it uses [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). See [examples](https://github.com/utshowmh/stuck/tree/main/examples) for syntax rules.

## Message from Author

This is a toy language I'm devoloping in order to learn how compilers, interpreters and generally computers works. Things I did or Algorithms I used are not probably most efficient ones. If you want, you can improve 'stack' by contributing to the repo (I would really really really apreciate that) or give me any suggessions on utshowmh@gmail.com (which I would also apreciate).

## Inspiration

This project was initially inspired by Alexey Kutepov's [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

## Build

In order to build 'stuck', you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed in your system. Then you'll be able to [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). After cloning, you'll have to [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) to 'stuck' and [build the project with cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html).
