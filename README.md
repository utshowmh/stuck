# STUCK

</br>

## About

Stuck is an interpreted [stack based programing language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

</br>

## Syntax

Since it's stack based, it uses [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). See [examples](https://github.com/utshowmh/stuck/tree/main/examples) for syntax rules.

## Message from Author

This is a toy language I'm devoloping in order to learn how compilers, interpreters and generally computers works. Things I did or Algorithms I used are not probably most efficient ones. If you want, you can improve 'stack' by contributing to the repo (I would really really really apreciate that) or give me any suggessions on utshowmh@gmail.com (which I would also apreciate).

</br>

## Inspiration

The implementation was initially inspired by Alexey Kutepov's [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) and the syntax are inspired from [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

## Build

In order to build 'stuck', you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed in your system. Then you'll be able to [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). After cloning, you'll have to [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) to 'stuck' and [build the project with cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html).
