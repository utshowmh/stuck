# STUCK

</br>

**About:**

---

Stuck is a low level compiled + interpreted [stack based programing language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Since it's stack based, it uses [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)

</br>

**Inspiration:**

---

This project is heavily inspired by Alexey Kutepov's [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

</br>

**Syntax:**

---

See [examples](https://github.com/utshowmh/stuck/examples) for syntax rules.

</br>

**Build:**

---

In order to build 'stuck', you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed in your system. Then you'll be able to [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). After cloning, you'll have to [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) to 'stuck' and [build with cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html).

**Usage:**

---

This is a toy language I'm devoloping in order to learn how compiler, interpreter and importantly computers works. Things I did or Algorithms I used are not probably most efficient ones. If you want, you can improve 'stack' by contributing to the repo (I'd really really really apreciate that) or give me any suggessions on utshowmh@gmail.com.
