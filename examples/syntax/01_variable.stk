# Working with Variables

var 400 @number        # declares a variable called number (it's like number = 400). you can also declare it like `400 @number`
number print           # prints value of number (it's like print(number))
number 20 + @number    # mutates number (it's like number = number + 20)
number print           # prints updated number
